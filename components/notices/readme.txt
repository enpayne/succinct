Succinct
========

Succinct is a minimal templating engine designed for concurrency and efficiency. It has an
especially abstract data model, allowing you to back your templates by fetching template
data on-demand, during render-time, according to your own complex synchronization protocols.
It comes with lots of tools to help you make your data "templatable."  

More information is available online, on the Succinct web site:
